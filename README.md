# code64
Code workings in Keras and Tensor flow to use various Machine Leanring models for currency trading.
The code is kept in its own separate envvironment as this is the 64 bit version.
The majority of the code here will be used to implement ANNs and more specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM)
There is also a section which is dedicated to running the code on a cloud server in order to speed up the training process.
